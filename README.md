(This page is a WIP, it'll look alot better in the future, I promise)
  
  Hello and welcome to my pony.town intro page! I go by Debil or Caleb and my main pronouns are it/he. I usually type with a typing quirk and don't like using proper grammar in conversation, but this page is gonna be typed normally so it's easier to read. If you need a translation for any anything I say in-game please tell me! I'm usually sitting at spawn matching with my friends or in either a skin of one of my theriotypes or my agere pride skin. I'm usually not actually regressed when I wear it, it's just a comfort skin for me.
